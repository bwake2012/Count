# count

A utility to count occurances of words in a text file.

This is adapted from the `Count` sample program for [ArgumentParser](https://apple.github.io/swift-argument-parser/). The frameworks for building command line utilities in Swift Package Manager have changed since most of the documentation and tutorials were written.
